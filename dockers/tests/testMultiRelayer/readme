test for multi-instance relayer.

note that currently these instances are the same image (in production, we only bring a 2nd instance
when we need a different image)
- bring up ganache docker, deploy contacts
- create 2-instances relayer docker config
- configuration is in build/relaydc2
- register relayer
- verify registering one will also make the 2nd instance registered
- verify the router works, and instances are separate
- make sure configuration is Ok, and they share a manager.

test structure
./init.sh - bring-up script (but doesn't register)
./done.sh - cleanup all docker images
./test.sh - run the init.sh, and on any exit (or abort) done script.

./r - wrapper to run "relaydc". accept any docker-compose params. 
	e.g. "./r config" to show the active configuration
	     "./r down" to shut down everything
note that "r" runs the ":test2" tag. in production, it should run the "latest", and in the far-future, 
a version pulled for the registry...
